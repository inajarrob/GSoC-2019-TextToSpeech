# Development of a Text To Speech component that operates offline for the EBO educational robot.

EBO is an educational robot that has the ability to express emotions. In addition, it has a programming platform designed in blocks so that children can learn to program in a simple way.

This robot lacked the ability to speak. This project has given EBO a voice offline. This voice has been generated from a neural network that has been trained to get a good tone.
